## Feature Highlights
### Posts
Users can share posts and photos on their wall and other users' walls. When sharing photos, users can see a preview of their photo prior to posting and cancel if desired. Users can only edit posts if they are the author. Users can delete posts if they are the author or if the posts are on their profile page. This allows more customization for what others can see when visiting their profile pages.
